 As you see here, I've copied the entire solution for the load balancing web server exercise, and I haven't made any changes to it. And I've also created several shell scripts to update UDAGRAM and the network templates. There are four shell scripts here, so obviously it can be improved to be a single shell script where you can do everything. Right? Okay, I've also created the network template, and this is exactly the same as the solution you've seen previously run the network. So it's completely run. But I haven't run the Udiagram template. And that's what we're going to do in the next page.
